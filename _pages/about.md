I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the [University of Macao](https://www.um.edu.mo/) and currently a Research Assistant Professor at the [School of Public Health](https://sph.hku.hk/en/Biography/Yang-Bingyi), University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on infectious disease transmission modeling, with an emphasis on immunodynamics, viral antigenic evolution, and the application of AI/machine learning to epidemiology.

My work combines mathematical modeling, statistical inference, and deep learning to address key questions in infectious disease transmission from predicting antigenicity changes to understanding correlates of protection against influenza and SARS-CoV-2. I am particularly interested in bridging genomic, serological and surveillance data with actionable insights for vaccine strain selection and pandemic preparedness.

**I am actively recruiting master, PhD students and postdocs** to join my group at the University of Macao. If you are interested in computational epidemiology, and infectious disease modeling, or AI applications in public health, please feel free to reach out via email. I welcome students from diverse backgrounds, including epidemiology, public health, computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
